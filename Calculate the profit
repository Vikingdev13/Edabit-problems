# You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product.
# You are given a dictionary containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars),
# and the starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar. Assume all of the
# inventory has been sold.
# Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost
